# Time-Series-Classification
Project for the course **"Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning"**. Given a dataset containing multiple time series, train a network able to classify correctly all of them. We implemented various techniques like *Augmentation*, *LSTM*, *Transformers*, and we were able to get 74% accuracy, which was only 1% lower than the best performance between all the groups (over 170) partecipating the challenge.

Professor: *Matteo Matteucci*

Final Score: **5.5/5** (award for particularly good projects)
